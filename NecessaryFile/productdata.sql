Join Milo, the long forgotten Bull Terrier, as he travels the world in search of nothing more than a friend he can call his own.
Milo & Ze is the eagerly-awaited second illustrated children\'s picture Bull Terrier dog book for kids by Mark Watson and Pablo Michau, authors of the bestselling, "The Shark in the Park". Milo & Ze makes the perfect Bull Terrier gift for kids, dog lovers and bully fans alike.
"Milo is a cute bull terrier puppy who has been forgotten, locked in a kennel, until one night a blinding light comes out of the night sky and smashes his kennel creating a crater that the bull terrier braves his way to peer into and hears a mole who asks his name and the little bull terrier discovers a fallen star: \'Never again need you wish for a friend, he waits for you at your journey\'s end.\' And off our bull terrier puppy goes on a journey, sees a truck, meets Big the Pig who invites him to his yacht which turns out to be a leaky barge but bull terrier Milo jumps ship and ultimately comes ashore to see Big the Pig safe and free. 
Milo meets a pelican who gives him a ride. The next ride is on a camel but a sandstorm hits, covers the little bull terrier, but he is discovered by an elephant who helps him on his journey. But more adventures arise - a tiger, a mountain goat, a cavern and finally, the little bull terrier puppy arrives at the door where lives an Indian lad by the name of Ze: Milo finally has a friend of his own.
Enchanting rhyming verse, exquisite illustrations and a heartwarming adventure that simply is restorative and makes the reader feel good. Searching for friends - a great goal and a wonderful destination. Highly recommended for children and art loving adults."
